== Ruby DDD Sample App

=== Goal

The goal of this sample app is to provide an idiomatic Ruby port of the DDD sample application. It should remain faithful to the intention of the purposes of the original DDD sample application:

* Providing a how-to example for implementing a typical DDD application (descriptive, not prescriptive)
* Support discussion of implementation practices
* Lab mouse for controlled experiments

==== DDD Sample Application

* link:https://github.com/patrikfr/dddsample[Written in Java in 2009].

History

* Sep 2008 First public release: 1.0.
* Jan 2009 Sample application tutorial at the JFokus conference in Stockholm.
* Mar 2009 Sample application tutorial at the QCon conference in London.

_The .NET port is being used as the primary basis for this Ruby port._

Details here about other sample apps. Things that are unique to this implementation.

== Implementation Stack

== Implementation TODOs

See milestones and issues in GitHub repository for high-level.

== Design Decisions

Information on design choices made, and the relative tradeoffs. Plus resources for further reading.

== Persistence

==== Mongo ORMs

* http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html[Mongoid] -  Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB written in Ruby. Has Echo sample app - take a look at `application.rb` - it's using Sidekiq and Kiqstand (not sure what for...maybe could be used for aggregate updates?)
* https://github.com/mongomatic/mongomatic[Mongomatic] -  A MongoDB super-set that adds nice features over the traditional Ruby Driver. Map your Ruby objects to Mongo documents. It is designed to be fast and simple. 
* http://mongomapper.com/[MongoMapper] - ODM for MongoDB written in Ruby.

=== Repository Pattern in Ruby

* https://github.com/nfedyashev/repository[A Ruby implementation of the Repository Pattern - In memory only], developed from https://github.com/alexch/treasury[Repository Pattern for Ruby - 3 years old]. 
* https://github.com/playlouder/persistence[A set of interfaces for, and implementations of, the Repository pattern in Ruby.] This one looks promising.
* https://github.com/brandonweiss/collector[Collector is an implementation of the Repository Pattern for MongoDB]
* https://github.com/braintree/curator[Curator is a model and repository framework for Ruby].Currently, curator supports Riak, MongoDB and an in-memory data store for persistence.

* http://www.pgrs.net/2012/03/08/data-migrations-for-nosql-with-curator/[Data migrations for NoSQL with Curator]. "Curator migrations are lazy, so at any given time you might have documents with different versions in the data store."
* https://gist.github.com/bokmann/2217602[ActiveRepository "Strawman" gist by David Bock]. Proposal for what a good Repository pattern implementation should look like in Ruby. Comment thread is excellent value.
* http://datamapper.org/[DataMapper 2] - goal is to create an ORM which is fast, thread-safe and feature rich. Last release was 1.2, but active development on v2 seems to be progressing.
* https://github.com/fredwu/datamappify[Datamappify] - is built using Virtus and existing ORMs (ActiveRecord and Sequel, etc). Compose and manage domain logic and data persistence separately and intelligently, Datamappify is loosely based on the Repository Pattern and Entity Aggregation. _Datamappify is current in Proof-of-Concept stage, do NOT use it for anything other than experimentation._

Have not yet found a repository implementation that supports aggregates. Rather, each implementation follows a repository-per-object approach, which is not what we need.

There is an on issue for Curator regarding https://github.com/braintree/curator/issues/16[ supporting foreign keys and embedded objects],  and some experimentation in a branch with adding a https://github.com/braintree/curator/commit/repository_mapping[mapping API] which may do what I need.

https://github.com/ifesdjeen/entrepot[Entrepot] looks promising. It uses Virtus for the objects and has this kinda weird approach of referencing a repository from a repository:

```
class Address
  include Virtus
  include Entrepot::Model

  attribute :street,  String
  attribute :city,    String
  attribute :country, String
end

class Person
  include Virtus
  include Entrepot::Mongo::Model

  attribute :name,     String
  attribute :address,  Address
end

class PersonRepository
  include Entrepot::Repository

  has_many :articles, :repository => :ArticleRepository
end
```

=== DDD and Rails

Implements restricted version of http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html[DataMapper pattern]. Datamapper 2 will be implementing the same pattern, but is not production-ready yet (see above)
