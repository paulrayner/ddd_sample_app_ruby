== Ruby DDD Sample App

=== Goal

The goal of this sample app is to provide an idiomatic Ruby port of the DDD sample application. It should remain faithful to the intention of the purposes of the original DDD sample application.

=== Why a Ruby port?

Because Paul wanted to learn Ruby and see how well it supports DDD. Also, interested in questions like:

* How does the choice of Ruby affect the implementation of the DDD building block patterns? 
* How well does an opinionated MVC framework like Rails support doing DDD? 
* What are implications of choosing a document store like MongoDB for aggregate design and eventual consistency?

=== Why a DDD Sample App?

1. Provide a how-to example for implementing a typical DDD application

* Descriptive, not prescriptive
* Idiomatic
* Update sample app with latest ideas

2. Support discussion of implementation practices

* Engage Ruby community in dialog and learning about DDD
* Show design and implementation tradeoffs
* Teach DDD (tend to be Java & .NET) community more about Ruby

3. Lab mouse for controlled experiments

* Learn Ruby as a language and ecosystem
* Can Rails + MongoDB carry the weight of a complex domain model?
* Tradeoffs between Sinatra vs Rails for Ruby web apps

=== DDD Sample Application

* link:https://github.com/patrikfr/dddsample[Written in Java in 2009].

*History*

* Sep 2008 First public release: 1.0.
* Jan 2009 Sample application tutorial at the JFokus conference in Stockholm.
* Mar 2009 Sample application tutorial at the QCon conference in London.
* Mar 2009 New public release: 1.1.0. See changelog for details.
* 2010/2011 https://github.com/SzymonPobiega/DDDSample.Net[Ported to .NET in several flavors].
* May 8, 2013 Begin porting to Ruby at https://github.com/paulrayner/ddd_sample_app_ruby
* May 13, 2013 Presentation of early work on port of sample app to Ruby at DDD Denver. Slides are http://virtual-genius.com/presentations/ddd_with_ruby_20130613.html[available online].

_The .NET port is being used as the primary basis for this Ruby port._

== Implementation Stack

=== Version 1 - Repositories & Sinatra

* Persistence: MongoDB
* Data access: Repositories (using Mongoid for MongoDB persistence)
* Domain model: Plain Ruby objects (as much as possible)
* UI: Sinatra, Javascript and Twitter bootstrap
* _GOAL: Minimal implementation of full stack by May 18_

_The focus of this version is to focus on the domain model, keeping it as free of other concerns (persistence, UI etc) as possible._ Keep the UI as lean and simple as possible (hence Sinatra).

=== Version 2 - Rails (i.e. ActiveRecord)

* Persistence: MongoDB
* Data access: Mongoid + Activerecord
* Domain model: Activemodel
* UI: Rails Forms, Javascript and Twitter bootstrap
* _GOAL: Before DDDx London - June 14_

_The focus of this version is to see how implementing the same domain model within Rails affects the implementation, and how it compares to Version 1._

== Contributing

This is a learning experiment, pull requests are welcome! Bonus points for feature branches.

To get started, see https://github.com/paulrayner/ddd_sample_app_ruby/issues?state=open[milestones and issues]. Use the https://github.com/SzymonPobiega/DDDSample.Net[vanilla .NET port version] as the basis for any work. 

Progress will be tracked through posts on http://thepaulrayner.com[Paul Rayner's blog].

== Aggregates

The aggregate roots are:

* Cargo
* HandlingEvent
* Location
* Voyage

== Design Decisions

Here you'll find information on design choices made, and the relative tradeoffs. Plus resources for further reading. Actually, mostly resources right now.

==== Mongo ORMs

* http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html[Mongoid] -  Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB written in Ruby. Has Echo sample app - take a look at `application.rb` - it's using Sidekiq and Kiqstand (not sure what for...maybe could be used for aggregate updates?)

=== Repository Pattern in Ruby

* https://gist.github.com/bokmann/2217602[ActiveRepository "Strawman" gist by David Bock]. Proposal for what a good Repository pattern implementation should look like in Ruby. Comment thread is excellent value.
* http://datamapper.org/[DataMapper 2] - goal is to create an ORM which is fast, thread-safe and feature rich. Last release was 1.2, but active development on v2 seems to be progressing.
* https://github.com/fredwu/datamappify[Datamappify] - is built using Virtus and existing ORMs (ActiveRecord and Sequel, etc). Compose and manage domain logic and data persistence separately and intelligently, Datamappify is loosely based on the Repository Pattern and Entity Aggregation. _Datamappify is current in Proof-of-Concept stage, do NOT use it for anything other than experimentation._

Have not yet found a repository implementation that supports aggregates. Rather, each implementation follows a repository-per-object approach, which is not what we need.

There is an on issue for Curator regarding https://github.com/braintree/curator/issues/16[ supporting foreign keys and embedded objects],  and some experimentation in a branch with adding a https://github.com/braintree/curator/commit/repository_mapping[mapping API] which may do what I need.

https://github.com/ifesdjeen/entrepot[Entrepot] looks promising. It uses Virtus for the objects and has this kinda weird approach of referencing a repository from a repository:

```
class Address
  include Virtus
  include Entrepot::Model

  attribute :street,  String
  attribute :city,    String
  attribute :country, String
end

class Person
  include Virtus
  include Entrepot::Mongo::Model

  attribute :name,     String
  attribute :address,  Address
end

class PersonRepository
  include Entrepot::Repository

  has_many :articles, :repository => :ArticleRepository
end
```
