== Ruby DDD Sample App

=== Goal

The goal of this sample app is to provide an idiomatic Ruby port of the DDD sample application. It should remain faithful to the intention of the sample application by:

* Providing 

==== DDD Sample Application

* link:https://github.com/patrikfr/dddsample[Written in Java in 2009].
* link:https://github.com/SzymonPobiega/DDDSample.Net[Port of Java 1.0 branch to .NET in 2010/2011] - using this as the primary basis for this port.

Details here about other sample apps. Things that are unique to this implementation.

Maybe (if I have time) could implement app in Rails using ActiveRecord with Mongoid, and then using repositories with Curator (and maybe Sinatra?). I wonder which one will be harder?

== Implementation TODOs

See milestones and issues in GitHub repository for high-level.

== UI - booking and tracking

* Views
** Booking
*** Assign to route
*** Cargo details
*** Change destination
*** List cargos
*** New cargo
** Handling
*** Register handling event
** Tracking
*** Track

* Controllers
** Booking
** Handling
** Tracking

== Design Decisions

Information on design choices made, and the relative tradeoffs. Plus resources for further reading.

== Persistence

=== MongoDB

=== Repository Pattern in Ruby

* http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2012/02/23/repository-pattern-in-ruby/
* https://github.com/nfedyashev/repository[A Ruby implementation of the Repository Pattern - In memory only], developed from https://github.com/alexch/treasury[Repository Pattern for Ruby - 3 years old]. 
* https://github.com/playlouder/persistence[A set of interfaces for, and implementations of, the Repository pattern in Ruby.] This one looks promising.
* https://github.com/brandonweiss/collector[Collector is an implementation of the Repository Pattern for MongoDB]
* https://github.com/braintree/curator[Curator is a model and repository framework for Ruby].Currently, curator supports Riak, MongoDB and an in-memory data store for persistence.

>Curator is a model and repository framework for Ruby. It's an alternative to ActiveRecord-like libraries where models are tightly coupled to persistence. Curator allows you to write domain object that are persistence free, and then write repositories that persist these objects. These ideas are largely taken from the Repository section of Domain Driven Design.

==== Mongoid

* Echo sample app - take a look at `application.rb` - it's using Sidekiq and Kiqstand (not sure what for...maybe could be used for aggregate updates?)
